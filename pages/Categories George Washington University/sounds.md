# Summary
Overall of those who left a review in this category **<Value data={polarity_proportions} column=percentage row=2/>%** had a **positive experience**, in comparison to **<Value data={polarity_proportions} column=percentage row=0/>%** who had a **negative experience**.


**Negative** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=0/> 

**Neutral** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=1/>

**Positive** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=2/> 

The university's soundscape seems to be a mix of harmony and cacophony, with students experiencing both the vibrant local music scene and the disruptive noise from fire alarms and frat houses. The positive remarks are fewer, suggesting that while there are pockets of tranquility, particularly on the north side, the overall sentiment leans towards the challenges of dealing with unwanted noise.

                       <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
The feedback from students indicates that there are several sound-related issues within the
university's dormitories and certain areas of the campus. The most prominent concerns
involve the frequency of fire alarms, particularly in the dorms, which are reported to go off
multiple times per week. Additionally, the thinness of the dorm walls is a recurring theme,
leading to a lack of privacy and an environment where students can easily hear their
neighbors. Noise disturbances from neighbors, including loud music and conversations, are
also mentioned, with some areas like southside being identified as noisier than others. There
are references to noise violations and quiet hours, suggesting that while the university has
policies in place, their enforcement may be inconsistent.

        <br>
        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Frequent fire alarms in dormitories ("20 fire alarms in the dorm", "dorms have fire alarms
that go off multiple times per week for no reason").
- Thin walls in dorms leading to lack of sound privacy ("dorm walls are incredibly thin", "walls
in the dorms are so thin though, so you can hear everything your neighbors say/do", "you
can hear through the walls").
- Noise disturbances from neighbors and other students ("be prepared to hear every word
your neighbor is saying", "noisy and rude neighbors", "play terrible music", "noisy neighbors
and drunks got away with everything scott free").
- Inconsistent enforcement of noise policies ("they're sometimes a bit too lenient on noises",
"there are times when they can't ignore a room full of drunk kids blasting music").
- Variability in noise levels across different campus areas ("southside is always louder",
"there are parts of campus, such as southside, that are noisier than others, such as
northside").


    </ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Review and enhance the fire alarm system to reduce false alarms.
- Investigate and potentially upgrade the soundproofing in dormitory walls.
- Enforce noise violation policies more consistently to ensure quiet hours are respected.
- Provide additional support and resources for students affected by noise disturbances, such
as offering alternative study spaces or soundproofing materials.
- Conduct a noise assessment of different areas on campus to identify and mitigate specific
problem spots

        <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        

The university environment presents a mix of sound levels across different areas, with some students
appreciating the quieter zones and others expressing frustration with noise disturbances. The
positive feedback indicates that there are specific locations such as the north side of the campus and
Mary Graydon, which offer a quieter atmosphere, especially valued by those residing in the suburbs.
Additionally, the presence of a dedicated quiet floor suggests that the university has made efforts to
accommodate students' needs for silent spaces. However, concerns about frequent fire alarms and
noise from social activities highlight areas for potential improvement.
        
<br>

<br>

    <b>List of positive aspects from customer reviews:</b>

<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Dedicated quiet areas ("there is a floor dedicated to that sound level")
- Suburban tranquility appreciated by residents ("i live in a suburb where it is quiet")
- Enjoyable local music scene ("local music scene")
- Morning quietude in Mary Graydon ("mary graydon is nicely quiet in the mornings")
- North side recognized for less noise ("north side is much quieter", "on north side you have a quieter
reputation")
- Availability of a quiet floor for studying or relaxation ("there is also the option of utilizing the quiet
floor")
- General satisfaction with manageable noise levels ("not too noisy")

</ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To further enhance the sound environment on campus, the university could investigate the
frequent fire alarm incidents and implement stricter policies or awareness campaigns to
reduce noise from social activities, especially in residential areas.
- Additionally, promoting the quiet zones and possibly expanding these areas could benefit
students seeking a peaceful study or living environment.
