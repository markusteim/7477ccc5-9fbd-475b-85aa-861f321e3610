**Positive** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=2/> 

In the realm of non-material values and value for money at the university, the sentiment is mixed with a tilt towards the negative. Students appreciate the diversity, inclusivity, and academic strength, particularly in political science and international relations. However, there's a strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction regarding the high cost of attendance, perceived lack of support for non-political majors, and administrative issues. The university's liberal atmosphere is both a draw and a point of contention, depending on individual political leanings.

                       <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
The university appears to be facing a multitude of challenges that affect student satisfaction
across various domains. Concerns range from financial burdens, such as high tuition fees
and expensive living costs, to dissatisfaction with administrative support and the handling of
immaterial values like ethics and diversity. Students have expressed frustration with the
perceived prioritization of the university's image over substantive reforms, ineffective
communication and support from advisors, and a lack of school spirit. Additionally, there are
reports of inadequate responses to issues such as hate crimes, drug and alcohol policy
enforcement, and a lack of support for students with disabilities. The narrative from the
snippets suggests a disconnect between the administration's actions and the students'
needs and expectations.

        <br>
        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- High tuition and living costs (e.g., "au is the second most expensive school in the nation",
"living on campus is incredibly expensive").
- Inadequate financial aid and scholarship support (e.g., "financial aid department is terrible",
"administration does not care about minorities on campus").
- Poor administrative support and responsiveness (e.g., "administration is awful", "advisors
don't know what they are doing").
- Lack of school spirit and community (e.g., "au has no school spirit", "barely any sense of
community").
- Ineffective handling of diversity and inclusion issues (e.g., "administration tries hard to give
the appearance of maintaining a safe environment on campus", "au lacks dignity").
- Inadequate response to hate crimes and safety concerns (e.g., "administration does not
take hate crime seriously when it occurs on campus").
- Insufficient support for students with disabilities (e.g., "au really needs to work harder to
address these concerns").
- Perceived prioritization of university image over substantive reforms (e.g., "administration
appears to prioritize the university's public image over substance reforms").
- Inconsistent enforcement of drug and alcohol policies (e.g., "au has very strict policies
concerning drug use and alcohol on campus; we're also non-smoking").
- Discontent with the handling of academic accommodations (e.g., "academic
accommodations are a joke").

</ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Review and potentially increase financial aid and scholarship offerings to better support
students in need.
- Enhance administrative support by providing additional training for advisors and ensuring
they are knowledgeable and responsive to student inquiries.
- Foster a stronger sense of community and school spirit through more inclusive events and
activities that engage the entire student body.
- Implement a more transparent and effective approach to handling diversity and inclusion
issues, ensuring that all students feel represented and supported.
- Improve the response to hate crimes and safety concerns by establishing clear protocols
and communication channels for reporting and addressing such incidents.
- Offer more robust support for students with disabilities, including accessible facilities and
academic accommodations.
- Reevaluate the enforcement of drug and alcohol policies to ensure consistency and
fairness, while also providing education and resources for substance abuse prevention.
- Increase transparency regarding the use of tuition fees and actively involve students in
discussions about university reforms and budget allocations.

    <Tab label="What does work">
        <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
Based on the provided snippets, the university exhibits a strong commitment to academic integrity, a
diverse range of academic programs, and a supportive environment for LGBTQ+ students. The
enforcement of academic policies and the importance placed on academics suggest a serious
educational atmosphere. The presence of various religious services and political activism indicates a
campus that is engaged and respectful of different beliefs and causes. Additionally, the availability of
technology and resources for students is noted as positive. However, there are concerns regarding
the administration's response to incidents of racism, antisemitism, and sexual assault, as well as the
overall diversity of the student body.

        
<br>

<br>

    <b>List of positive aspects from customer reviews:</b>

<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Academic integrity and importance (e.g., "academics are much more important here," "au is pretty
stiff about academic violations such as plagiarism").
- Support for LGBTQ+ community (e.g., "au is extremely lgbt friendly," "we have a very large glbtq
community that comes with a very large ally community as well").

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To further improve the university's environment, the administration could take more
proactive measures in addressing and preventing incidents of racism, antisemitism, and
sexual assault.
- Efforts to increase the diversity of the student body, particularly in terms of race and
socioeconomic status, could also be enhanced.
- Additionally, fostering a more inclusive atmosphere where all students feel represented and
heard could contribute to a more positive campus culture.
