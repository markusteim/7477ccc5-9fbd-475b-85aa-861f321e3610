                       <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
The university is facing challenges related to the social and safety aspects of student life,
particularly concerning sexual experiences. Reviews indicate dissatisfaction among students
regarding the limited pool of potential dating partners, with concerns about the attractiveness
and availability of straight males. Additionally, there are serious concerns about sexual
assault, with multiple instances reported both on and off-campus. The term 'AU goggles'
suggests a perceived need to lower dating standards due to the limited options. The
presence of negative experiences related to fraternity culture and sexual misconduct is also
evident.

        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Limited dating pool and dissatisfaction with attractiveness of students ("as a female student
this can be very frustrating", "au is not known for having an attractive student body").
- Gender ratio imbalance affecting dating prospects ("effects of the gender ratio are horrible
for straight girls", "male to female ratio is way off").
- Concerns about the prevalence of sexual assault and safety on campus ("occasional
sexual assault issues", "rape and sexual assault is a prevalent problem").
- Negative perceptions of fraternity culture ("gross frat guys", "lots of frats are also infamous
for sexual assault").
- Instances of stalking and harassment ("stalked by a graduate student", "there was a man
on Massachusetts Ave. (near campus) who was sexually assaulting women").


    </ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To address these issues, the university could implement comprehensive sexual
assault prevention and response programs, including mandatory training for all
students and staff. Increasing support services for victims of sexual misconduct, such
as counseling and legal assistance, is crucial.
- The university should also review and enforce strict policies against harassment and
assault, with clear consequences for violations.
- To improve the social climate, the university could facilitate more diverse social
events and activities that encourage interaction among students.
- Additionally, promoting a culture of respect and inclusivity within the student body,
including within fraternity and sorority life, is essential.
