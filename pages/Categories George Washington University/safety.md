                       <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
The university appears to have a range of safety and security concerns expressed by
students. Issues range from thefts, particularly of laptops, to concerns about walking alone at
night and the presence of crime in surrounding areas. Students have also mentioned the
need to be cautious with belongings and the importance of locking doors. There are
references to incidents on campus and in nearby neighborhoods that contribute to a feeling
of unease. Some students have indicated that the university tries to enforce safety policies,
but there is a sentiment that more proactive measures could be beneficial. The presence of
emergency blue light poles and campus security is noted, but there are still reports of feeling
unsafe and incidents of crime.

        <br>
        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Difficulty in obtaining accommodations (accommodations are incredibly difficult to obtain).
- Incidents around the school (all the incidents around the school).
- Theft in dorms due to unlocked doors (all the laptop being stolen in the dorms because
students decided not to deadbolt their doors).
- Concerns about post-graduation job prospects (although finding a job post-grad looks slim
for most graduates).
- Perception of administration's attentiveness to student safety (although I made numerous
friends at American University and have been given amazing opportunities I wish the
administration were more attentive to the safety of each student).
- Advice to always lock doors and walk with a friend (always lock your door to prevent thefts,
always walk with a friend).
- Sketchy areas and unsafe neighborhoods (can be sketchy at times, can be unsafe).
- Drug and alcohol visibility (however, as far as alcohol visibility and drug use).
- High racial tension (high racial tension).
- Concerns about safety at frat parties (I feel less safe at frat parties).
- Theft of unattended belongings (theft in the library when unattended laptops are left for the
public).
- Incidents near metro stops (there is going to be some crime near the metro stops).
- History of violence and crime rates in D.C. (history of violence, crime rates in D.C. is worse
than you think).
- Presence of pests in dorms (most of my friends have had mice or rats in their dorms).


    </ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To address these concerns, the university could consider enhancing security
measures, such as increasing patrols in areas where incidents are reported and
improving the security of dormitories with better locks or access control systems.
- Additionally, providing more resources and support for students seeking
accommodations could alleviate some of the stress associated with feeling unsafe.
- The university might also benefit from offering more safety education programs,
including how to secure belongings and awareness of surroundings.
- Improving communication about safety incidents and the measures taken in
response could help build trust between the administration and the student body.
- Finally, fostering a more proactive approach to safety and security, rather than a
reactive one, could contribute to a safer campus environment.

    <Tab label="What does work">
        <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
Based on the provided snippets, the university appears to maintain a level of safety and security that
is satisfactory to many students. The campus is described as being in a safe neighborhood with
visible security measures such as campus police patrols, emergency call boxes, and a blue light
system. Students feel comfortable walking around campus at various hours, and there is a sense of
community safety. The university also seems to provide ample opportunities for internships and jobs,
which contributes to a sense of security regarding future prospects. While there are mentions of
incidents and concerns, these do not dominate the overall sentiment expressed by the students.

        
<br>

<br>

    <b>List of positive aspects from customer reviews:</b>

<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Safe neighborhood (AU is in one of the safest neighborhoods in D.C.)
- Visible security measures (at least one security vehicle is always within sight, blue light system,
campus police patrols)
- Comfortable campus environment (students feel safe walking around, campus is well lit and
patrolled)
- Internship and job opportunities (plentiful in D.C., administration assists with city navigation)
- Community and diversity (students of different backgrounds feel connected and respected)
- Health and safety measures (AU has taken action to prevent incidents, free sexual-assault defense
classes)
- Reliable transportation (AU shuttles are pretty reliable)
- Preparedness for emergencies (public safety is only a call away, panic buttons available)

</ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To further enhance safety and security, the university could consider increasing the visibility
of security measures in areas where students have reported feeling less secure.
- Additionally, addressing concerns about theft and unauthorized access to buildings could
improve the sense of security.
- Offering more workshops on personal safety and security, as well as promoting the existing
resources more actively, could also help ensure that all students are aware of how to stay
safe on campus.
