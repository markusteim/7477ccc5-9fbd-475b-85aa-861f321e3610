In the realm of olfactory experiences at the university, the sentiment skews towards the negative, with more instances of unpleasant odors being reported than those of fresh and pleasant scents. The negative comments focus on the prevalence of smoke-related smells, which seem to be a common issue around campus areas, particularly near dorms and building entrances.

                       <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
The feedback from students indicates that there are concerns regarding the presence of
smoke around the university premises. The issues seem to be centered around the smell of
cigarettes and marijuana, which are occasionally noticed in various locations such as dorm
rooms and near building entrances. The frequency of these occurrences is not specified, but
the use of the word "occasionally" suggests that it is not a constant issue. However, it is
clear that the presence of smokers, particularly near building entrances, is a point of
discomfort for some students.

        <br>
        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Occasional smoking around the campus (except people smoking occasionally).
- Instances of marijuana odor emanating from dorm rooms (occasionally you will walk past a
dorm room and get a strong whiff of marijuana).
- Smoking near building entrances (students smoke right next to building entrances).
- General presence of smokers on campus (there are a lot of smokers, too, which can be
obnoxious).


    </ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To address the concerns raised, the university could consider implementing stricter
smoking policies, including designated smoking areas that are situated away from
building entrances and common areas.
- Additionally, the university could increase awareness and enforcement of existing
smoking regulations to ensure compliance.
- For the issue of marijuana odors, the university might need to review and reinforce its
policies on drug use within dormitories and take appropriate disciplinary actions when
necessary.
- Regular communication with students about the importance of respecting smoke-free
zones and the impact of smoking on the community could also be beneficial.

        <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        

The feedback from the student reviews regarding smells within the university indicates that there is
at least one aspect of the environment that is appreciated: the sense of fresh air. This suggests that
the university has managed to maintain a level of cleanliness or has outdoor spaces that are
well-kept, contributing to a pleasant olfactory experience for students. While the information is
limited, it is clear that the fresh air is a positive feature that enhances the campus atmosphere.
        
<br>

<br>

    <b>List of positive aspects from customer reviews:</b>

<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Freshness of air (Excerpt: "gives me a sense of fresh air")

</ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To further improve the olfactory experience for students, the university could consider
regular maintenance of indoor air quality, perhaps through the use of air purifiers or
ensuring that HVAC systems are frequently serviced.
- Additionally, if the fresh air is a result of well-maintained outdoor spaces, continuing to
invest in landscaping and outdoor areas would be beneficial.
- Encouraging a smoke-free campus, if not already in place, could also contribute to
maintaining the positive perception of air quality.
