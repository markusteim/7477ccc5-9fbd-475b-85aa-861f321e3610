                       <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
The student reviews suggest that there is a perceived lack of inclusivity and community at
the university. Students have reported feeling isolated, particularly if they are not part of
specific social groups such as athletics, Greek life, or certain majors. There is a sentiment
that the administration and faculty are indifferent to student needs and that the campus
culture can be unwelcoming and cliquey. Additionally, there are concerns about
discrimination and a lack of support for students with diverse political views or those who do
not conform to the dominant social norms.

        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>

don't really care about its students").
- Social isolation and difficulty finding a sense of belonging (e.g., "can feel socially lacking,"

about graduate students," "hard for a minority to find and connect").

bureaucratic and unhelpful," "can be a bit unaccepting of certain minorities").

- Issues with inclusivity and political affiliation (e.g., "inclusion is a problem when it comes to
political affiliation," "much of the school is not very understanding and inclusive").
