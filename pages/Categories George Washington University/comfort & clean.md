The reviews present a mixed bag of sentiments regarding comfort and cleanliness at the university. While there are numerous positive remarks about spacious and clean dorms, well-kept facilities, and mild weather, there are also significant complaints about cramped rooms, pest issues, and unpredictable weather patterns. The positive experiences seem to slightly outweigh the negative ones, but the concerns raised are not trivial and point to areas needing improvement.

                       <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
    The student reviews indicate a range of issues related to comfort and cleanliness at the
university. Concerns about the weather, including cold, heat, humidity, and rain, are
frequently mentioned, affecting both the comfort of the students and the condition of the
facilities. The dormitories are a particular point of contention, with numerous comments
about their size, cleanliness, and general state of disrepair. Problems with pests such as
mice, rats, and cockroaches are noted, as well as issues with mold. The common areas,
including bathrooms and showers, are reported to be unclean and not maintained well.
Additionally, the university's facilities, such as the gym and library, are described as too small
and often overcrowded. The fluctuating weather also seems to exacerbate the discomfort
experienced by students.

        <br>
        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Inadequate spacing and overcrowding (e.g., "spacing is hard to deal with," "everyone's
packed together").
- Uncomfortable weather conditions (e.g., "cold in the winter," "hot and humid in the
summer").
- Poor dormitory conditions (e.g., "dorms are not good," "dorm living conditions are dismal").
- Cleanliness issues (e.g., "bathrooms are usually pretty gross," "cleanliness is the biggest
problem").
- Pest infestations (e.g., "prominent mice/rat problem," "apartment is slightly known for its
cockroach problem").
- Maintenance problems (e.g., "old appliances," "showers have terrible water pressure").
- Insufficient facilities (e.g., "gym is pretty small for university size," "library isn't that large").
- Weather-related discomfort (e.g., "au is like a huge wind tunnel," "it rains every
Wednesday").


    </ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>

<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To address these issues, the university could implement a more rigorous and
    frequent cleaning schedule, especially for common areas and bathrooms.
-    Pest control measures should be intensified to tackle the infestation problems.
-    The dormitories may require renovations to improve living conditions, including better
    space management and maintenance of appliances.
-    The university could also consider expanding or optimizing the use of existing
    facilities to alleviate overcrowding.
-    Weatherproofing measures, such as better insulation and heating systems, could
    improve comfort during extreme weather conditions.
-    Additionally, providing more accurate and timely weather information could help
    students prepare for the day&#39;s conditions.

        <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
The student reviews present a mixed picture of the comfort and cleanliness at the university. While
there are mentions of issues such as pests and cramped conditions, there are also numerous positive
comments about the state of the facilities. The dorms are generally described as clean, well-kept,
and often spacious, with individual AC/heating units being a notable feature. The campus itself is
appreciated for its cleanliness and the condition of its athletic facilities. Off-campus housing options,
particularly the Berkshire apartments, are frequently mentioned as popular and convenient. The
weather is noted for its variability, with all four seasons experienced, but it does not seem to
significantly impact the students' campus experience. Overall, while there are areas for
improvement, many aspects of the university's facilities and living conditions are meeting the
students' needs.

        
<br>

<br>

    <b>List of positive aspects from customer reviews:</b>

<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Individual AC/heating units in dorm rooms (All the dorm rooms have individual AC/heating units
though)
- Cleanliness of campus and dorms (Campus is clean, dorms are clean and sufficient)
- Athletic facilities are well-kept (Athletic facilities themselves are very nice and well-kept)
- Daily cleaning of bathrooms (Bathrooms are cleaned daily so they're usually fine)
- Spacious dorm rooms (Dorm rooms are large, rooms are pretty spacious)
- Availability of off-campus housing options (Most popular off campus housing option is the Berkshire
apartments)
- Well-maintained residence halls (Residence halls are clean)
- Ample storage space in living areas (There is ample storage space)
- Clean public areas (Public bathrooms and lounges are cleaned everyday which is nice)
- Variety of room options (Options to live in a single, double or triple rooms)
- Weather is manageable and does not disrupt campus life (Overall, the weather is more than
manageable)

</ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To further improve the student experience, the university could address the issues raised
about pests and maintenance problems. Implementing more rigorous pest control measures
and regular maintenance checks could help alleviate concerns about cleanliness and
livability.
- Additionally, considering renovations or updates to the older dorms could improve
perceptions of comfort.
- Expanding on the positive aspects, such as the individual climate control in rooms and the
cleanliness of public spaces, would also enhance the overall student satisfaction with the
university's facilities.
