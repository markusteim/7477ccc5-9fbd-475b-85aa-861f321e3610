        <br>
        
Based on the provided snippet, there appears to be a concern regarding inadequate lighting within the university. The specific feedback indicates that at least one area or aspect of the campus is considered "very poorly lit." This suggests that the lighting levels may not be sufficient for students to feel comfortable and secure, which could potentially affect their ability to navigate the campus safely or study effectively in certain locations.

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Inadequate lighting in certain areas (Snippet: "very poorly lit").


    </ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To address the lighting concern, the university could conduct a thorough assessment of the lighting across the campus, especially in areas where students frequently study or transit during evening hours. 
- This assessment should identify zones with insufficient lighting. 
- Following the assessment, the university could upgrade existing lighting fixtures, install additional lights where necessary, and ensure that all lighting systems are well-maintained. 
- It may also be beneficial to consider energy-efficient LED lighting to improve visibility while being cost-effective in the long run.
