                       <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
The feedback from students indicates that there are specific concerns regarding the
adequacy of lighting within the university, particularly in the bathrooms and shower areas of
the housing facilities. The students have expressed that these areas are not sufficiently
bright, which impacts their satisfaction with the campus amenities. Additionally, there is a
mention of some areas on campus that could benefit from improved lighting. While the
comment about it being "pretty cloudy" could refer to weather conditions, it may also suggest
that the overall ambiance or lighting in certain locations feels dim or gloomy.

        <br>
        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Insufficient lighting in bathrooms (bathrooms aren't very bright).
- Lack of adequate lighting in shower areas (better lighting for the showers would definitely
benefit the campus).
- General dissatisfaction with the darkness in housing bathrooms (housing would get a better
grade if the bathrooms weren't so dark).
- Some campus areas are not well-lit (some areas could be better-lit).


    </ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To address the concerns raised by the students, the university could conduct a
thorough assessment of the lighting in the bathrooms and shower areas within the
housing facilities to identify the need for additional fixtures or brighter bulbs.
- It may also be beneficial to perform a campus-wide lighting audit to determine other
areas that require improved lighting solutions.
- Implementing motion-sensor lights could enhance visibility while conserving energy.
- Additionally, ensuring regular maintenance of existing lighting fixtures to prevent
outages and dimming over time would help maintain adequate lighting levels
throughout the campus.

        <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
The feedback from students regarding visibility within the university premises indicates a positive
reception of the natural lighting. The comments specifically highlight the presence of large windows
that allow for a substantial amount of natural light to permeate the learning spaces. This aspect of
the university's design seems to contribute positively to the students' experience, suggesting that the
current architectural features that facilitate natural lighting are appreciated and effective.

        
<br>

<br>

    <b>List of positive aspects from customer reviews:</b>

<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- Presence of natural light ("another huge plus is the amount of natural light")
- Architectural design with large windows ("huge windows")
- Effectiveness of natural light in visibility ("large amount of natural light")

</ul>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ul style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

- To further enhance the student experience, the university could consider maintaining the
cleanliness and clarity of the windows to ensure maximum natural light penetration.
- Additionally, if any future renovations or new constructions are planned, the university might
continue to prioritize large window designs to sustain and improve upon this positive aspect.
- It would also be beneficial to conduct periodic assessments of areas where natural light may
be insufficient and consider installing appropriate artificial lighting solutions to complement
the natural light during overcast days or in interior spaces lacking direct sunlight.
